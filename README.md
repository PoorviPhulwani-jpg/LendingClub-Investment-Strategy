# LendingClub Investment Strategy
A data-driven portfolio optimization project leveraging peer-to-peer loan data from LendingClub to develop a risk-aware investment strategy. This project uses clustering, regression modeling, and Sharpe ratio analysis to construct a diversified loan portfolio with an expected return of 4.42%.

## Objective
To maximize investment returns while managing credit risk by identifying borrower segments and designing a portfolio that balances risk and reward.

## Key Insights
- Used K-Means clustering to group borrowers into 7 distinct risk profiles.
- Assigned risk levels using the standard deviation of predicted returns from Ridge regression.
- Developed portfolio strategies based on Sharpe ratios, return thresholds, and risk profiles.
- Final 100-loan portfolio delivered a 4.42% expected return ‚Äî outperforming all benchmark strategies.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning**: Ridge Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Means Clustering
- **Optimization**: Sharpe Ratio, Return-Risk tradeoff modeling
- **Data Source**: LendingClub loan data (public dataset)
